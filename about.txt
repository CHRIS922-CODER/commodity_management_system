Yes, Django can work without an internet connection. Django is a web framework that runs on a server, which means that it is designed to handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses. However, it is also possible to use Django to create standalone applications that do not require an internet connection.

To create a standalone Django application that does not require an internet connection, you can follow these general steps:

1. Create a Django project: Use the `django-admin startproject` command to create a new Django project. This will create a basic project structure with a settings file, URLs file, and other necessary components.

2. Create a Django app: Use the `python manage.py startapp` command to create a new Django app. This will create a directory with the app name and a set of files, including views, models, and templates.

3. Define your models: Define your data models in the `models.py` file. This will allow you to create and manipulate data in your standalone application.

4. Create your database: Use a local database management system, such as SQLite, to create your database. You can configure Django to use a local database by modifying the `DATABASES` setting in the settings file.

5. Build your views and templates: Build your views and templates to handle requests and generate responses in your standalone application.

6. Test your application: Use the `python manage.py runserver` command to start the development server and test your standalone application. You can access your application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

Overall, Django can be used to create standalone applications that do not require an internet connection. By using a local database and running the development server on your local machine, you can build and test your application without relying on an internet connection.


Sure, here are some general steps you can follow to build a stock management system using Django:

Plan and define the requirements: Before you start coding, you should plan out your application and define the features and functionality that you want to include in your stock management system. This might include managing products, tracking inventory levels, recording sales, generating reports, and more.

Set up the Django project: Once you have a clear idea of what you want to build, you can set up your Django project by creating a new project using the django-admin startproject command. You will also need to create a new Django app for your stock management system using the python manage.py startapp command.

Design the database schema: You will need to design the database schema for your stock management system using Django models. This might include models for products, inventory levels, sales, and more. You can use the Django ORM to interact with your database.

Create views and templates: Once you have your database schema set up, you can start creating views and templates to display your data to users. You will need to create views for displaying lists of products, individual product details, inventory levels, and more. You will also need to create templates that define the structure and layout of your web pages.

Implement user authentication and authorization: You will need to implement user authentication and authorization in your stock management system to ensure that only authorized users can access certain features and data. You can use Django's built-in authentication system or third-party packages like Django-allauth to handle user authentication.

Add functionality for managing products: You will need to add functionality for managing products in your stock management system, including creating new products, updating product details, and deleting products. You can use Django forms to handle user input and the Django ORM to interact with your database.

Add functionality for tracking inventory levels: You will need to add functionality for tracking inventory levels in your stock management system, including updating inventory levels when products are sold or restocked. You can use Django signals to automatically update inventory levels when certain events occur.

Add functionality for recording sales: You will need to add functionality for recording sales in your stock management system, including tracking the quantity of products sold and generating invoices. You can use Django forms to handle user input and the Django ORM to interact with your database.

Add functionality for generating reports: You will need to add functionality for generating reports in your stock management system, including sales reports, inventory reports, and more. You can use Django's built-in support for generating PDFs or third-party packages like ReportLab to generate custom reports.

Test and deploy your application: Once you have implemented all the necessary functionality, you should thoroughly test your application to ensure that it is working correctly. You can then deploy your application to a production server using a platform like Heroku or AWS.

These are just general steps to follow, and there may be additional steps or considerations depending on the specific requirements of your stock management system.

Once you have gathered the requirements for your stock management app, you can follow these general steps to build it using Django:

1. Set up the Django project:
   - Install Django: Ensure that Django is installed in your development environment.
   - Create a new Django project: Use the `django-admin` command or Django's `startproject` command to create a new project.
   - Set up the database: Configure the database settings in the project's settings file (`settings.py`) to use PostgreSQL.

2. Define the models:
   - Create Django model classes that represent the entities in your stock management system, such as `Product`, `Category`, `Department`, and so on. Define the necessary fields and relationships between the models using Django's field types (e.g., `CharField`, `ForeignKey`, etc.).
   - Add methods to the models for performing specific operations or calculations related to stock management.

3. Create the database tables:
   - Run Django's migration command (`python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`) to create the necessary database tables based on your models.

4. Create views:
   - Define Django view functions or class-based views that handle the logic for rendering templates and processing requests related to stock management operations.
   - Map the views to appropriate URLs using Django's URL configuration (`urls.py`).

5. Design templates:
   - Create HTML templates using Django's template language to define the user interface for various stock management pages.
   - Use Django's template tags and filters to display dynamic data and handle forms.

6. Implement forms:
   - Create Django forms to handle input validation and data submission for stock management operations like receiving stock, issuing products, etc.
   - Map the forms to appropriate views and templates.

7. Implement authentication and authorization:
   - Integrate Django's built-in authentication system or a third-party library to manage user authentication and authorization.
   - Define user roles and permissions to control access to different stock management functionalities.

8. Implement business logic:
   - Write the necessary code to implement the business logic of your stock management system, such as receiving stock from the government, updating stock quantities, recording issuances, and monitoring remaining stock.
   - Use Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to query and manipulate data from the database.

9. Test and debug:
   - Write test cases using Django's testing framework to ensure the correctness of your code.
   - Debug and fix any issues or errors that arise during testing.

10. Deploy the app:
    - Choose a hosting platform or server to deploy your Django app, such as Heroku, AWS, or a self-hosted server.
    - Configure the deployment settings, including environment variables, database connections, and static file serving.
    - Deploy your app and make it accessible to users.

Remember to follow the Django documentation and best practices throughout the development process. Customize the steps according to your specific requirements and project structure.
